Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Overview
---------------

This introductory course helps students learn to pose questions and analyze problems in the international development planning field. Not arguing for one "right" approach, the course draws on grounded empirical experiences -- historical and recent -- to help students navigate the way they approach their future work in developing-country governments, international organizations, and NGOs.

Requirements
------------

Five short written papers (up to 6 pages double-spaced) will be assigned throughout the semester -- roughly every two weeks (schedule below, and further details in class for each assignment). This is for the purpose of facilitating discussion of the readings in class. No late papers will be accepted. On the last day of class, students will recount in class a few ways in which their thinking about issues changed as a result of the readings (more detailed instructions later; students not able to attend the last day of class can arrange beforehand to submit the same assignment in writing). There will be no mid-term or final paper or exam, and the last paper will fall due at least one week before the end of the semester.

Grades
------

Grades will be based on participation in class, knowledge of the readings as demonstrated in class discussions, written assignments, and the extent to which students show improvement over the course of the semester. Attendance in class is obligatory.
